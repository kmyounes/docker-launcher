## Synopsis

Small script and first one written in python by me, that helps to start docker containers from file list or start all containers.


## Motivation
I have been testing many containers, then i forgot names of containers that i need for specific tasks.
By putting containers ID in file named same as the need, it's easier to manage containers.

## Usage

```
https://github.com/kmyounes/docker-launcher.git && cd docker-launcher
./docker-launcher --help
```
